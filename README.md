Homework for Module 2 - VBA
In this project, I analyized stock data to produce yearly changes by ticker, percent change in stock, and total stock volume. 
Using this data, I compiled the stock ticker with the largest increase percentage, largeset decreased percentage, and largest total value using VBA scripting to automate this process for use across multiple sheets/years of stock data analysis.

Utilized assistance with Professor Booth and Xpert.
